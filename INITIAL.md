# Human-like Appointment Confirmation Voice Agent

## FEATURE:
Build a LiveKit voice agent using a voice pipeline architecture that combines Deepgram's Nova-2 for speech recognition, GPT-4o-mini for conversation logic, and OpenAI's Nova voice for text-to-speech. The agent will act as a warm, professional receptionist making courtesy calls to confirm appointments 24 hours in advance.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Businesses need to confirm appointments with customers 24 hours in advance to reduce no-shows and remind clients of upcoming appointments. Currently, this requires human staff to make phone calls, which is time-consuming and expensive. An automated voice agent that sounds natural and human-like can handle these routine confirmation calls, freeing staff for more complex tasks while maintaining a professional, personalized customer experience.

## CORE REQUIREMENTS:

### Voice Pipeline Configuration
- **STT**: Deepgram Nova-2 for real-time speech recognition
- **LLM**: GPT-4o-mini for fast, intelligent conversation management
- **TTS**: OpenAI Nova voice (female, professional but friendly, normal pace)
- **Turn Detection**: LiveKit's VAD + semantic turn detection model for natural flow

### Conversation Characteristics
- Natural conversation elements including:
  - Filler phrases ("um", "let me see", "one moment")
  - Natural pauses when processing information
  - Acknowledgment sounds ("mm-hmm", "I see", "got it")
  - Response variation to avoid sounding scripted
- Maintain full conversation history throughout the call
- Natural error recovery with clarification phrases and rephrasing
- Persistent conversation until successful completion or customer hangup

### Agent Personality
The agent should embody a polite, professional, yet warm-sounding receptionist. Their job is to call customers who already have booked appointments to check if they are still able to attend. Calls are typically made approximately 24 hours before the appointment to confirm attendance and serve as a reminder.

### Technical Requirements
- Sub-200ms latency when deployed on AWS
- Local development initially, then AWS Docker deployment
- Support for concurrent calls based on worker pool configuration
- Graceful handling of network interruptions and service failures

## EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:

### Conversation Flow
1. Agent initiates call and introduces itself professionally
2. Confirms appointment details (date, time, service)
3. Handles various responses naturally:
   - Confirmation: Thank and end call politely
   - Rescheduling requests: Acknowledge and provide next steps
   - Confusion: Clarify purpose and appointment details
   - Technical issues: Use natural recovery phrases

### Error Handling
- If speech recognition fails: "Sorry, could you repeat that?"
- If multiple attempts needed: Provide progressively more context
- If wrong person: Politely ask for the intended recipient
- Persist naturally until goal achieved or customer ends call

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Voice sounds convincingly human with natural speech patterns
- Turn detection allows smooth conversation without awkward interruptions
- Agent maintains context and adapts to customer responses
- Successfully confirms or updates appointment status
- Handles confusion and errors gracefully
- Achieves sub-200ms latency in production

## EXAMPLES:
Reference the LiveKit agents examples in `/Users/andrep/Documents/code/livekit-agents-main/examples/`, particularly:
- `voice_agents/` - For voice pipeline patterns
- `minimal_worker.py` - For basic agent structure

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- Start with manual testing to evaluate naturalness
- Plan for future enhancements like voicemail detection
- Consider call recording for quality improvement (with consent)
- Prepare for multilingual support in future iterations
- Ensure HIPAA compliance if handling medical appointments
