# Customer Support Voice Agent - Initial Requirements

## FEATURE:
Build an intelligent customer support voice agent using LiveKit that can handle common inquiries, access customer information, and escalate complex issues to human agents when necessary. The agent should provide natural, conversational interactions with sub-second response times.

## CORE REQUIREMENTS:

### Voice Interaction
- Natural conversational flow with interruption handling
- Support for multiple languages (English, Spanish, French)
- Emotional context preservation in responses
- Professional yet friendly personality

### Functional Capabilities
- Answer frequently asked questions
- Look up order status and tracking information
- Process simple account updates (address, phone)
- Schedule callbacks with human agents
- Escalate complex issues appropriately

### Integration Requirements
- Connect to customer database API for account lookup
- Integration with order management system
- Callback scheduling system integration
- Analytics and conversation logging

### Performance Requirements
- Sub-second response time for initial greeting
- Less than 2 seconds for database lookups
- Handle 100+ concurrent sessions
- 99.9% uptime availability

## EXAMPLES:
The following example patterns from LiveKit examples should be referenced:
- `basic_agent.py` - Basic voice agent structure and session management
- `weather_agent.py` - Function tool implementation for external API calls
- `multi_agent.py` - Agent handoff pattern for escalation

Key patterns to implement:
- Function tools for database lookups
- Multi-agent handoff for escalation
- State management for conversation context
- Error handling for API failures

## DOCUMENTATION:
- LiveKit Agents Documentation: https://docs.livekit.io/agents/
- Voice Pipeline Guide: https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/
- Function Tools: https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/tools/
- Multi-Agent Workflows: https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/workflows/

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

### Security
- Customer data must be handled securely
- PII should not be logged in plain text
- API keys must use environment variables
- Rate limiting for database queries

### Conversation Design
- Agent should introduce itself clearly
- Confirm customer identity before sharing information
- Provide clear escalation paths
- Handle connection issues gracefully

### Deployment
- Kubernetes deployment with auto-scaling
- Multi-region deployment for low latency
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Cost optimization for high volume

### Common Issues to Address
- Background noise in customer environments
- Multiple speakers (customer with family)
- Network connectivity issues
- Language switching mid-conversation
- Handling profanity or frustration

### Success Metrics
- Average handle time < 3 minutes
- First call resolution > 70%
- Customer satisfaction > 4.5/5
- Successful escalation rate < 20%

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all function tools
- Integration tests with mock APIs
- Load testing for 100+ concurrent sessions
- Voice quality testing in noisy environments
- Multi-language conversation testing
