# Integration Test Report - Appointment Confirmation Agent

**Test Date**: July 28, 2025  
**Tester**: Claude Code

## Test Environment

- **Token Server**: ‚úÖ Running on port 8002
- **Frontend**: ‚úÖ Running on port 3000  
- **LiveKit Agent**: ‚úÖ Running and connected

## Test Results

### 1. Service Connectivity
- ‚úÖ All services started successfully
- ‚úÖ Token server health check passing
- ‚úÖ Frontend able to generate tokens
- ‚úÖ Agent registered with LiveKit cloud

### 2. Voice Pipeline Testing

#### Speech-to-Text (STT)
- ‚úÖ **Deepgram STT working correctly**
- Successfully transcribed: "See there"
- Successfully transcribed: "Hey. Just checking if you can hear me."
- Audio duration tracked: 35.8 seconds total

#### Language Model (LLM)
- ‚ùå **OpenAI API quota exceeded**
- Error: "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details"
- Error code: 429 (rate limit/quota exceeded)
- Unable to generate responses

#### Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- ‚ùì **Unable to test** - No LLM responses to convert to speech

### 3. Code Issues Found and Fixed

#### Issue 1: AgentSession API Change
- **Error**: `AttributeError: 'AgentSession' object has no attribute 'chat_ctx'`
- **Root Cause**: Using outdated API pattern
- **Fix Applied**: Changed from `self.session.chat_ctx.append()` to `await self.session.say()`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

### 4. Integration Issues

#### Issue 1: Agent Process Path
- **Error**: `FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory: appointment_agent.py`
- **Root Cause**: Agent was started from wrong directory
- **Fix Applied**: Restarted agent from project root
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

#### Issue 2: Missing user_id Parameter
- **Error**: Frontend API getting 422 from token server
- **Root Cause**: Token server requires user_id field
- **Fix Applied**: Added user_id generation in frontend API
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

## Action Items

### Critical (Blocking)
1. **Add OpenAI API Credits**
   - Current API key has no remaining quota
   - Visit https://platform.openai.com/usage
   - Add credits or use different API key

### High Priority
1. **Test Natural Speech Features**
   - Cannot verify filler phrases without LLM working
   - Cannot test interruption handling
   - Cannot verify response variation

2. **Verify Voice Pipeline End-to-End**
   - Need to confirm TTS output quality
   - Test complete conversation flow
   - Measure actual latency

### Medium Priority
1. **Add Error Handling**
   - Better handling for API quota errors
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Fallback responses

2. **Add Monitoring**
   - Track API usage to prevent quota issues
   - Monitor response times
   - Log successful/failed interactions

## Recommendations

1. **Set up API usage alerts** in OpenAI dashboard
2. **Consider implementing a quota check** before starting sessions
3. **Add retry logic** with exponential backoff for API errors
4. **Create a test mode** with mock responses for development

## Summary

The integration test revealed that all components are properly connected and the STT pipeline is working. However, the LLM quota issue prevents full end-to-end testing. Once OpenAI credits are added, the system should work as designed.

**Overall Status**: üü° Partially Working (blocked by API quota)
